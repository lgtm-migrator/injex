## Installation

Start by installing the core package. This package includes most of the functionality you're going to use when working with the Injex framework.

```bash
npm install --save @injex/core
```

After the core is installed and based on your project, you need to install a runtime container. The runtime container enables modules definition and registration across your application.

You can currently choose between the Node or Webpack runtimes for the server or the client, respectively.

#### Node Runtime

Create a dependency-injection container inside a Node.JS application.

```bash
npm install --save @injex/node
```

#### Webpack Runtime

Create a dependency-injection container inside a Webpack bundled client-side application.

```bash
npm install --save @injex/webpack
```

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

Create an Injex Node runtime container.

```typescript
import { Injex } from "@injex/node";

Injex.create({
    rootDirs: [
        "./src"
    ]
}).bootstrap()
```

Injex will scan all the files and folders recursively and look for Injex modules.

Module definition example:

```typescript
// src/services/mailService.ts
import { define, singleton, inject } from "@injex/core";

@define()
@singleton()
export class MailService {
    @inject() private mailProvider: IMailProvider;

    public sendMail(mail: Mail) {
        this.mailProvider.send(mail);
    }
}
```

Since Injex automatically scans all the files and folders inside the `rootDirs`, this is all you need to do to create an injectable module.

### Plugins

Injex is pluggable, so you can use and create your plugins to enrich your applications.

ðŸ“¦ **Env Plugin** - Manage environment variables across your application. [Docs &#8594;](https://www.injex.dev/docs/plugins/env)

ðŸ“¦ **Express Plugin** - Use Injex to power up your Express application by creating controllers, better route handlers, and middlewares. [Docs &#8594;](https://www.injex.dev/docs/plugins/express)

ðŸ“¦ **React Plugin** - Use React hooks to inject dependencies into components. [Docs &#8594;](https://www.injex.dev/docs/plugins/react)
